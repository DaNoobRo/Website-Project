<h3>Short History of the begining of prosthetic hands</h3>
<p>
From as early as 77 A.D. when Marcus Sergius, a Roman general,
lost his hand in battle and had it replaced with an artificial one that
he could use to ride a horse and fight in battle, people have used prosthetic
hands to function. Throughout the ages, advancements in artificial hands have
improved from body-powered prostheses used after World War I to modern ones found
today that use electric power and even intuitive control to make the prostheses work.
</p>
<p>
Among the most famous examples of an early hand prosthesis was the iron hand of
German knight Götz von Berlichingen. After Götz lost his hand during the Siege of
Landshut (circa 1505) in Bavaria, an artisan fashioned him an iron hand with digits
that could be flexed and extended passively at the metacarpophalangeal,
proximal interphalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints,
as well as the thumb interphalangeal joint.
</p>
On strapping on the prosthesis, Götz was able to hold reins, grip weapons and return
to battle.
The device was modelled as an extension of battle armour rather than a human arm and,
due to its weight, needed to be attached to Götz’s armour with thick leather straps.
</p>
<p>
One of the first descriptions of a noncombative hand prosthesis was in 1600 by Italian
surgeon Giovanni Tommaso Minadoi, who described an amputee who could remove his hat,
untie a purse and even write with a quill.
</p>
<p>
In the 16th century, French military surgeon Ambroise Paré drew the first detailed
design of a spring-loaded prosthetic hand, nicknamed ‘Le Petit Lorrain’ after the
craftsman who fashioned it. Paré also drew a prosthetic arm for an above-elbow
amputation.
</p>
<p>
The concept of an 'automatic' body-powered upper limb prosthesis was pioneered
by German dentist Peter Baliff in 1818. Using transmission of tension through
leather straps, Baliff’s device enabled the intact muscles of the trunk and shoulder
girdle to elicit motion in a terminal device attached to the amputation stump.
For the first time, an amputee was able to operate his prosthesis with fluid body motions,
rather than as a distinct foreign object. In the 1860s, the Comte de Beaufort in
France adapted the design for use by wounded soldiers. A shoulder harness with a
strap buttoned to the trousers was passed through a loop to the contralateral axilla
and missing limb, allowing an amputee to manipulate the strap tension to open and close
a double spring hook, or flex and extend the thumb on a simple hand with fused fingers
