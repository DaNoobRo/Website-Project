	<h1><strong>Passive</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		This mostly nonfunctional type of prosthetic hand is used mainly for cosmetic purposes.
		Some of these passive hands can have fingers that the user can bend or reposition if desired.
		The passive artificial hand is made to match the other hand as much as possible and
		is then fitted with a vinyl or silicone glove that can match the person's skin tone.
		In addition, the gloves are customizable to match what their real hand would look like with matching veins and fingernails.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Body-Powered</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		A simple form of movable prosthetic hands uses body power to control the hand.
		A series of cables attached to the artificial hand and to a harness that the user
		wears let the person open or close the hand by moving their shoulder or upper arm.
		This system uses a voluntary opening of the hand triggered by the user, and then the
		hand voluntarily closes once pressure is released through the cable system.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Myoelectric</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		This functional type of prosthetic hand is called a myoelectric prosthesis.
		The muscles of the affected arm work together with electrodes fitted inside of the prosthetic hand.
		When the person contracts the muscles of the limb, electrical outputs send a message to the
		artificial hand to open or close it. Conveniently, electric-powered hands also let the user change
		the speed at which they can open and close the hand. With the addition of a wrist rotator,
		the person can also twist and turn their wrist.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Hybrid</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		For those who have lost a substantial amount of their limb, a hybrid prosthesis is a viable option.
		Using a combination of body power and electrical power control, a hybrid prosthesis is best used for
		a transhumeral prosthetic that can move the elbow, hands, and fingers simultaneously.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Activity-Specific</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		In general, activity-specific prosthetics attach to an already existing one designed for
		specific activities, such as fishing, running, sewing, or playing a musical instrument.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Bionic</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		iLimb and iLimb Digits are multifunctional prosthetic hands that articulate in various directions,
		including rotating the thumb. With bionic limbs, the user has more use and function of the wrist
		and individual fingers through the use of computers and specialized sensors.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Ultrasound Sensor Control</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		Using ultrasound sensors can help the user control movement within individual prosthetic fingers.
		Ultrasound technology can help those who want or need finite control over their hands,
		such as someone playing a musical instrument or when performing intricate finger work.
		Unlike electromyogram sensor-controlled prosthetic hands that require pressing buttons to change modes,
		ultrasound control lets the user move their fingers spontaneously.

	</h3>
	<h1><strong>Intuitive or Mind-Control</strong></h1>
	<h3>
		One of the most advanced prosthetic advancements today is using intuitive control to move the hand.
		This device uses residual nerve input from the limb ending to control the prosthetic hand.
		When the user thinks about moving the hand or fingers, the brain sends the message through the existing
		nerves into electrodes inside of the prosthetic to engage movement without any external help.
